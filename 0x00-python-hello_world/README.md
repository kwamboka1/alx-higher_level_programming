# Hello, World
Project done during **ALX Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about variables, basics commands (print) and handle strings with **Python**.
## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
